### 1. 🎯 Clear & Personalized Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"Hi...I am 21 years old man who has gained weight and is looking to reduce it. I am currently weighing 85 kg. What changes should I make in my diet and what exercises should I do?"

**Why it works:**  
Instead of being vague like "How to stay fit?", this is specific, includes age, weight, and goals. It returned highly tailored diet plans, exercise routines, and motivation strategies.

### 2. 📋 Output Formatting Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"Create a table comparing Python, Java, and C++ in terms of syntax simplicity, speed, and use cases."

**Why it works:**  
This format instruction ("in table form") made ChatGPT respond with a clean, structured comparison table — very useful for reports or learning.

### 3. 🧑‍🏫 Role-Based Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"Imagine you are a career advisor. What would you suggest to me, a graduate 2.5 CGPA BS SE student with no strong skills, to stand out?"

**Why it works:**  
By assigning a role ("career advisor"), the answer became practical, serious, and customized to my academic and career profile. Great for interview prep or mentorship bots.

### 4. 🧠 Few-Shot Example Prompt
**Prompt:**  
"Change the sentences into concise and clear bullet points.  
Example 1: Pakistan is a beautiful country with its capital being Islamabad and financial hub being Karachi.  
Output:  
1. Pakistan is a beautiful country.  
2. Its capital is Islamabad.  
3. Its biggest city is Karachi.  

Now do this:  
I am Maaz. My father's name is Sohail and my mom's name is Huma. I study in UIT and live in Karachi."

**Why it works:**  
Giving a specific example first helped the AI match the style, tone, and format in the second response — a key Few-Shot learning strategy.

**Why it works:**
